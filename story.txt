### **User Story 1: Storefront - Slack Integration**  
**Title:** Storefront to Slack Integration for Device Request Workflow  

**Description:**  
As a user, I want my device request on the storefront to trigger an automated workflow so that approvals can be managed efficiently via Slack.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- As a user, I want my device request on the storefront website to be stored in the PostgreSQL database so that my request is recorded for further processing.  
- As a user, I want my email address from the device request to be used to fetch my details and my managerâ€™s email address from Microsoft Entra via Graph API so that the approval process can be initiated correctly.  
- As a user, I want the system to push my request details to Slack based on my managerâ€™s email ID so that my request reaches the appropriate approver.  
- As a user, I want my manager to receive a Slack notification via a Slack bot, ensuring that they can take action on my device request.  
- As a user, I want error handling mechanisms in place so that if any step (Graph API call failure, Slack API failure, etc.) fails, proper logs and alerts are generated.  

**Technical Notes:**  
- Use **FastAPI** for API development.  
- Implement **Microsoft Graph API** integration for fetching user and manager details.  
- Use **Slack Bolt SDK** to send messages to Slack.  
- Ensure **PostgreSQL** stores request details for tracking.

### **User Story 2: Slack Workflow Development**  
**Title:** Slack-Based Approval Workflow for Device Requests  

**Description:**  
As a user, I want an interactive Slack workflow that allows my manager to approve or reject device requests so that the approval process is seamless and efficient.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- As a user, I want my manager to receive a Slack notification with an interactive message containing "Approve" and "Reject" buttons so that they can take action on my request.  
- As a user, I want the Slack bot to retrieve the managerâ€™s details based on the email address provided by the storefront so that the notification reaches the correct approver.  
- As a user, I want the system to capture the response (Approve or Reject) and store it in the database along with a timestamp so that audit tracking is maintained.  
- As a user, I want to ensure that once the manager acts on my request, a response is sent back confirming the action taken so that I am aware of my request status.  
- As a user, I want the system to retry Slack message delivery if the initial message fails so that notifications are not lost due to transient errors.  

**Technical Notes:**  
- Use **Slack Bolt for Python** to handle interactive message buttons.  
- Implement a **Slack listener** to capture user responses.  
- Store the approval/rejection response and timestamp in **PostgreSQL**.  
- Use **FastAPI** to expose APIs for Slack event handling.

### **User Story 3: Remedy Integration**  
**Title:** Integration with Remedy for Request Processing  

**Description:**  
As a user, I want my approved or rejected request details to be sent to Remedy so that further processing and tracking can be handled externally.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- As a user, I want my request approval/rejection status to be sent to the Remedy external API so that my request is processed accordingly.  
- As a user, I want the system to transform and format the data before sending it to Remedy to ensure the API receives it in the correct format.  
- As a user, I want proper authentication and authorization mechanisms when calling the Remedy API so that secure communication is maintained.  
- As a user, I want error-handling mechanisms that log failures and retry the API call if needed so that failures do not block the request flow.  
- As a user, I want to receive a confirmation once my request has been successfully processed by Remedy so that I am aware of the final status of my request.  

**Technical Notes:**  
- Use **FastAPI** to call the Remedy external API.  
- Ensure **OAuth or API Key authentication** for secure API calls.  
- Implement logging and retry mechanisms for robust error handling.  
- Store API responses in **PostgreSQL** for reference and debugging.
